The outcomes of this project will play a pivotal role in supporting the DHL-FI project. The FNB encompasses metadata for over a million documents, including books, newspapers, maps, etc., with records spanning from 1488 to the present. For more details about Fennica, visit The National Finnish Library website.\nCurrently, the bookdown project comprises a few distinct chapters. Notably, the harmonization process has been executed through the establishment of dual pipelines: Complete FNB Pipeline and 1809 to 1917 Period Pipeline These chapters are dedicated to the specific metadata categories."
