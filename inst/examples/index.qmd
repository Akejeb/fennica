##Preface chapter

It is imperative to underscore that this bookdown project is an evolving **work-in-progress**, and several additional fields will be incorporated into the dataset as they undergo the rigorous processes of data cleaning, harmonization, and enrichment.

Within the [DARIAH-FI](https://www.dariah.fi/metadata-harmonization-and-analysis/) and [FIN-CLARIAH](https://www.kielipankki.fi/organization/fin-clariah/deliverables/) Metadata Harmonization and Analysis work package, we use the Finnish national bibliography (FNB) Fennica dataset to create a harmonized dataset that can be used for research purposes as well as provide the groundwork for infrastructure that can be iterated further. The outcomes of this project will play a pivotal role in supporting the [DHL-FI](https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/fi/projektit/digitaaliset-menetelmat-kotimaisen-kirjallisuushistorian-uudistajana) project. The FNB encompasses metadata for over a million documents, including books, newspapers, maps, etc., with records spanning from 1488 to the present. For more details about Fennica, visit The National Finnish Library [website](https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en/services/fennica-finnish-national-bibliography).

Currently, the bookdown project comprises a few distinct chapters. Notably, the harmonization process has been executed through the establishment of dual pipelines: **Complete FNB Pipeline** and **1809 to 1917 Period Pipeline** These chapters are dedicated to the specific metadata categories.
