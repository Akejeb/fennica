Analysis of Finnish national bibliography (Fennica) Data Collection
============================================

This is an algorithmic toolkit for [R](http://r-project.org), designed for fully transparent quantitative analysis of the Finnish national bibliography [Fennica](http://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/kirjastoala/fennica.html) metadata collection.

The tools are under active, open development; the tools, analysis, and documentation are being constantly updated. Your [contributions](http://ropengov.github.com/contact.html), [bug
reports and feedback](https://github.com/ropengov/estc) are welcome!

### Data overview

results are summarized in the following automatically generated files:

 * [Summary of the Fennica metadata](https://github.com/rOpenGov/fennica/blob/master/inst/examples/summary.md)


### Reproducible analysis

The algorithmic details to reproduce these summaries from the raw data are fully documented by the [source code](https://github.com/rOpenGov/fennica/blob/master/inst/examples/summary.md).

This includes several steps from raw data extraction to harmonizing the textual annotation fields, preprocessing the information, and carrying out statistical analysis and visualization. The raw data is confidential at the moment and available only on a separate agreement, so we can only publish statistical summaries and the our own analysis source code at this site. 

Whereas this package focuses on Fennica, it utilizes additional
tools from the more generic
[bibliographica](https://github.com/rOpenGov/bibliographica) and many
other R packages.
