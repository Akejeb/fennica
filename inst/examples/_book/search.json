For the remaining documents, critical dimension information was not available or could not be interpreted: List of entries where document surface could not be estimated\nDocument gatherings info is originally available for 440 documents (44%), and further estimated up to 456 documents (46%) in the final preprocessed data.\nDocument height info is originally available for 39 documents (4%), and further estimated up to 479 documents (48%) in the final preprocessed data.\nDocument width info is originally available for 0 documents (0%), and further estimated up to 479 documents (48%) in the final preprocessed data.\n\nThese tables can be used to verify the accuracy of the conversions from the raw data to final estimates:\n\nDimension conversions from raw data to final estimates\nAutomated tests for dimension conversions\n\nThe estimated dimensions are based on the following auxiliary information sheets:\n\nDocument dimension abbreviations\nStandard sheet size estimates\nDocument dimension estimates (used when information is partially missing)"
